# Info, TODOS, questions and ideas

## Info
- Claim races are the most common and at the same time the most unpredictable
- Maidens are horses that never won a race, can be new
- If we take as correct the Haversine formulae applied in `notebooks/sainth/edas.ipynb`, we could infer that at in a 58 feet runup, some horses reach 10 readings of trakus.
- Again, taking into account Haversine formulae, the distance tracked greatly differs from "race distance", as much as 20 mts in some cases


## To Do
- [x]Get info about `trackus` and `ran up distance`
- []Check if we can identify when a jockey wins a Maiden race and then participates in a Maiden race again, meaning that the horse is new
- [x] Graphic `track_type` and `track_condition` grouping by `track_id`
- [] To get instant velocity and tangent aceleration, we need to get the position vector, we need to check how to obtain it
