# Info, TODOS, questions and ideas

## Info
- Claim races are the most common and at the same time the most unpredictable
- Maidens are horses that never won a race, can be new

## To Do
- Check if we can identify when a jockey wins a Maiden race and then participates in a Maiden race again, meaning that the horse is new
- Graphic `track_type` and `track_condition` grouping by `track_id`
